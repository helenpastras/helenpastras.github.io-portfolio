                        <p>My name is Helen Pastras and I am a Product Manager amongst my many things! I come from a Hospitality software background; I’ve been a Product manager for 6 years and worked for a SaaS Property management startup in NY and then for one of the original forces in the industry responsible for allowing your first online hotel reservations to take place.</p>
                        <p>I was always fascinated with the techy side of things, but never involved enough, until I got in! I was actually on the very opposite side, of being very "un-techy" but I am improving every day!</p>
                        <p>I’m originally from Greece, where I studied hospitality management, then became a New Yorker for several years before realizing how much I missed the sun and good fortune brought me in Southern California. My husband Michael and I make chocolates from scratch (Bean to Bar) which takes a lot of time but makes everything smell great! I love exploring different parts of California as I can, either discovering random parts of town or connecting more with nature whether sea, forest or desert.</p>
                        <p>(Guilty admission: I’m a huge Harry Potter fan, but no, I don’t play Quiddich!)</p>
